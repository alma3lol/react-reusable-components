# React Reusable Components - StorybookJS

> A project full of reusable react components

## How to use it

You can use as few or as many components from this project into another project by viewing them and deciding which suits your project, then copy the component's files (a `.jsx` & an `.scss`) to your project.  
And with a little modification, the component of choice is ready for use.

## How to run the Storybook

Just type in terminal:

```bash
npm run storybook
```
